## class and object

# **The Human class has three methods:**

- __init__: This is the constructor method that initializes instances of the Human class with a name (n) and an occupation (o).

- **do_work:** This method checks the occupation of the human instance and prints a corresponding message indicating what type of work they do.

- **speaks**: This method simply prints a message indicating that the human instance is speaking and saying "how are you?"

# **Two instances of the Human class are created:**

- **tom:** An instance representing Tom Cruise, an actor.

- **maria:** An instance representing Maria Sharapova, a tennis player.

- For each instance, the do_work method is called, followed by the speaks method, to demonstrate the actions of each human instance.

- After the instances are created and their methods are called, the code doesn't do anything else.  

## Example

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self,name,roll_num,marks):
        self.name =  name
        self.roll_num  = roll_num
        self.marks =  marks
        
        student2.roll_num
```
